## Platforms

### What do we call a platform?

A platform is an environment where an application can run. An application is written and built for a certain platform or platforms.

From a user's point of view, knowing the platform an application is written for helps answering the question: "can this application run on my machine?"

From a programmer's point of view, being asked to write an application for a certain platform means trying to answer the questions: "what tools and information do I need to do the job?"

### Current platforms

Platforms that are still actively developed.

### Retrocomputing platforms

Platforms that are no longer developed, including old versions of current platforms when too many incompatibilities have arisen.
