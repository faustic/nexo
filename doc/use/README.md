## How to use

This library is not yet ready for general use. Requirements may change quickly. Interfaces may change quickly. When not, it often just means that development is stalling.

When the library becomes stable enough, this document will become a user's guide, addressed to developers who want to use Nexo with their own software projects, but do not necessarily wish to modify Nexo itself.

In the meanwhile, most of the project documentation will deal with the [development](../dev/README.md) of Nexo, rather than its use.
